                <p>&quot;The discerning one walketh amongst men AS amongst animals.&quot;</p>
<p>Great obligations do not make grateful, but revengeful; and when a small kindness is not forgotten, it becometh a gnawing worm.</p>
<p>It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult. And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him who doth not concern us at all.</p>
<p>And if a friend doeth thee wrong, then say: &quot;I forgive thee what thou hast done unto me; that thou hast done it unto THYSELF, however—how could I forgive that!&quot;</p>
<p>Ye want reward for virtue, and heaven for earth, and eternity for your to-day?</p>
<p>Ah! this is my sorrow: into the basis of things have reward and punishment been insinuated—and now even into the basis of your souls, ye virtuous ones!</p>
<p>Ah! their crying also hath reached your ears, ye virtuous ones: &quot;What I am NOT, that, that is God to me, and virtue!&quot;</p>
<p>And others are there who are like eight-day clocks when wound up; they tick, and want people to call ticking—virtue.</p>
<p>And when they say: &quot;I am just,&quot; it always soundeth like: &quot;I am just—revenged!&quot; With their virtues they want to scratch out the eyes of their enemies; and they elevate themselves only that they may lower others.</p>
<p>And again there are those who love attitudes, and think that virtue is a sort of attitude. Their knees continually adore, and their hands are eulogies of virtue, but their heart knoweth naught thereof.</p>
<p>Ah! my friends! That YOUR very Self be in your action, as the mother is in the child: let that be YOUR formula of virtue!</p>
