                <p>A ninety-year-old man went to the doctor and said, “Doctor, my eighteen-year-old wife is expecting a baby.” The doctor said, “Let me tell you a story. A man went hunting, but instead of a gun, he picked up an umbrella by mistake. When a bear suddenly charged at the man, he picked up the umbrella, shot the bear, and killed it.” The man said, “Impossible. Someone else must have shot that bear.” The doctor said, “My point exactly!”</p>
<p>First things first, he says. Before we answer any question, big or small, we need to understand what the question itself signifies.</p>
<p>Mrs. Goldstein was walking down the street with her two grandchildren. A friend stopped to ask her how old they were. She replied, “The doctor is five and the lawyer is seven.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Goldstein was walking down the street with her two grandchildren. A friend stopped to ask her how old they were. She replied, “The doctor is five and the lawyer is seven.” Does human life have a telos?</p>
<p>“Why is an elephant big, gray, and wrinkled?” “Because if he was small, white, and round, he’d be an aspirin.”</p>
<p>Two cows are standing in the pasture. One turns to the other and says, “Although pi is usually abbreviated to five numbers, it actually goes on into infinity.” The second cow turns to the first and says, “Moo.”</p>
<p>philosopher came along who took exception to this notion of a compulsive God who has his finger in everything.</p>
<p>Achilles and the tortoise? Naturally, Achilles can run faster than the tortoise, so the tor toise is given a big head start. At the gun—or as they said in the fifth century b.c., at the javelin—Achilles’s first goal is to get to the point where the tortoise started. Of course, by then the tortoise has moved a little way. So now Achilles has to get to that spot. By the time he gets there, the tortoise has moved again. No matter how many times Achilles reaches the tor toise ’s prior location, even if he does it an infinite number of times, Achilles will never catch up with the tortoise, although he ’ll get awfully close. All the tortoise needs to do to win the race is to not to stop.</p>
<p>“Cogito ergo sum” (“I think, therefore I am”),</p>
<p>A man is worried that his wife is losing her hearing, so he consults a doctor. The doctor suggests that he try a simple athome test on her: Stand behind her and ask her a question, first from twenty feet away, next from ten feet, and finally right behind her. So the man goes home and sees his wife in the kitchen facing the stove. He says from the door, “What’s for dinner tonight?” No answer. Ten feet behind her, he repeats, “What’s for dinner tonight?” Still no answer. Finally, right behind her he says, “What’s for dinner tonight?” And his wife turns around and says, “For the third time— chicken!”</p>
<p>Kant went about the task of answering this question by dividing statements into two categories: analytic and synthetic.</p>
<p>There’s a surefire way to live to a ripe old age—eat a meatball a day for a hundred years.</p>
<p>Kant gave primacy to pure reason, so much so that he saw little need for personal experience in solving the problems of knowledge.</p>
<p>when it comes to mathematics, there are three kinds of people: those who can count and those who can’t.</p>
<p>one man’s good is another man’s goodies.</p>
<p>Nietzsche has been blamed for everything from German militarism to sauerkraut:</p>
<p>Freudian slip.”</p>
<p>Dimitri: I was talking to Zeus the other day, and he thinks you’re a bad influence on me. Tasso: That’s interesting, because I think he’s a bad influence on you. Dimitri: In what way? Tasso: He makes you think the voices in your head are real.</p>
<p>This is fine as long as the waiter is conscious that it’s only a role. But we all know waiters who believe they truly are waiters, that that is who they essentially are. Très mauvaise foi!</p>
<p>A man goes into the confession booth and tells the priest, “Father, I’m seventy-five years old and last night I made love to two twenty-year-old girls—at the same time.” The priest says, “When did you last go to confession?” The man says, “I’ve never been to confession, Father. I’m Jewish.” The priest says, “Then why are you telling me?” The man says, “I’m telling everybody!”</p>
<p>A couple goes on vacation to a fishing resort. While he’s napping, she decides to take his boat out on the lake and read. While she’s soaking up the sun, the local sheriff comes by in a boat, and says, “There’s no fishing allowed here, ma’am. I’m going to have to arrest you.” The woman says, “But, sheriff, I’m not fishing.” The sheriff says, “Ma’am, you have all the necessary equipment. I’m going to have to run you in.” The woman says, “If you do that, sheriff, I’m going to have to charge you with rape.” “But I haven’t even touched you, ” says the sheriff. “I know, ” she says, “but you have all the necessary equipment.”</p>
