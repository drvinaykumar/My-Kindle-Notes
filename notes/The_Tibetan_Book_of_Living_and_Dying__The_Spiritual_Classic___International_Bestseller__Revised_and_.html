                <p>It is said by the masters that even a little poison can cause death and even a tiny seed can become a huge tree. And as Buddha said: “Do not overlook negative actions merely because they are small; however small a spark may be, it can burn down a haystack as big as a mountain.” Similarly he said: “Do not overlook tiny good actions, thinking they are of no benefit; even tiny drops of water in the end will fill a huge vessel.”</p>
<p>With constant repetition our inclinations and habits become steadily more entrenched, and go on continuing, increasing, and gathering power, even when we sleep. This is how they come to determine our life, our death, and our rebirth.</p>
<p>“How will I be when I die?” The answer to that is that whatever state of mind we are in now, whatever kind of person we are now: that’s what we will be like at the moment of death, if we do not change. This is why it is so absolutely important to use this lifetime to purify our mindstream, and so our basic being and character, while we can.</p>
<p>“You know, don’t you, that actually all these things around us go away, just go away . . .”</p>
<p>“three wisdom tools”: the wisdom of listening and hearing; the wisdom of contemplation and reflection; and the wisdom of meditation.</p>
<p>“ego.”</p>
<p>In Tibetan ego is called dak dzin, which means “grasping to a self.”</p>
<p>The fact that we need to grasp at all and go on and on grasping shows that in the depths of our being we know that the self does not inherently exist. From this secret, unnerving knowledge spring all our fundamental insecurities and fear.</p>
