                <p>Jakob von Gunten, “I must stop writing for today. It excites me too much. The letters flicker and dance in front of my eyes.”</p>
<p>Victor Hugo could well be applied to this relationship between Rimbaud and his illustrious predecessor Socrates: “There are some mysterious men who can only be great. Why are they great? Even they do not know. Might He who has sent them know? They possess a terrible vision in their eyes that never abandons them. They have seen the ocean like Homer, the Caucasus like Aeschylus, Rome like Juvenal, the inferno like Dante, paradise like Milton, man like Shakespeare. Drunk with fantasy and intuition in their almost unconscious advance over the waters of the abyss, they have crossed the strange line of the ideal, which has penetrated them for ever … A pale shroud of light covers their countenance. Their soul emerges through their pores. What soul? God.”</p>
<p>“To write,” Marguerite Duras remarked, “is also not to speak. It is to keep silent. It is to howl noiselessly.”</p>
<p>Someone has compared Walser to a long-distance runner who is on the verge of reaching the longed-for finishing-line and stops in surprise, looks round at masters and fellow disciples, and abandons the race, that is to say remains in what is familiar, in an aesthetics of bewilderment.</p>
<p>Seneca claimed that fame is horrible because it depends on the judgement of many.</p>
<p>The Internet, for example, is new, but the net has always existed. The net fishermen used for catching fish serves now not to enclose prey, but to open up the world to us. Everything remains, but changes; the everlasting is repeated mortally in the new, which is gone in a flash.</p>
<p>“Happiness is the understanding that the ground on which he has stopped cannot be bigger than the area covered by his feet”,</p>
