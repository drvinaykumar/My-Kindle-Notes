                <p>A mended plate or a mended reputation is better than a cracked plate or a damaged reputation. But a plate that has never been cracked and a reputation that has never been damaged are better still.’</p>
<p>Heartlessness is a grave human fault and is unforgivable when combined with profligacy, greed, sloth, and disorderliness; but when combined with boundless energy and a rigid sense of order and public decency, heartlessness takes on a different character altogether. It becomes a divine attribute.</p>
<p>‘As easily as a dog squats’ and ‘There are more ways than one of killing a cat’ and ‘You mind your own business, I’ll mind mine’ and ‘I’ll see that it gets done on the Greek Kalends’ (which, of course, means never) and ‘The knee is nearer than the shin’ (which means that one’s first concern is with matters that affect one personally). And if anyone tried to contradict him on a point of literary scholarship, he used to say: ‘A radish may know no Greek, but I do’. And whenever he was encouraging anyone to bear an unpleasant condition patiently he always used to say: ‘Let us content ourselves with this Cato’.</p>
<p>‘Words fail me, my Lords. Nothing that I might utter could possibly match the depth of my feelings in this matter.’</p>
<p>‘Do you know the Jewish version of Deucalion’s Flood? The Jewish Deucalion was called Noah, and he had three married sons who, when the Flood subsided, repeopled the earth. The eldest was Shem, the middle one was Ham, and the youngest was Japhet. Ham was punished for laughing at his father when he accidentally got drunk and threw off all his clothes, by being fated to serve the other two, who behaved with greater decency. Ham is the ancestor of all the African peoples. Japhet is the ancestor of the Greeks and Italians, and Shem the ancestor of the Jews, Syrians, Phoenicians, Arabians, Edomites, Chaldeans, Assyrians, and the like. There is an ancient prophetic saying that if Shem and Japhet ever live under the same roof there will be endless bickering at the fireside, at the table, and in the bed-chamber.</p>
<p>‘You’re a fool, as I’ve always told you. But you have fool’s luck. And fool’s luck holds. You’ll be an Olympian God when I’m only a dead hero; yes, don’t blush, for that’s how it will be, though there’s no question which of us two is the better man.’</p>
<p>‘There’s too much meat in that sausage,’ he said, ‘and not enough spices and garlic.’ He meant that there was too much information in it and not enough elegant writing.</p>
<p>He sowed with the sack, as the saying is, and some of the seed seemed to sprout at once.</p>
<p>Do thou resist that man with all thy might Who, unprovoked, provokes thee to a fight.</p>
<p>Plato who wrote that the only sound excuse that anyone can offer for ruling is that by doing so he avoids being ruled by people inferior in talents to himself?</p>
<p>“Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn”.</p>
<p>Aquila non captat muscas. The eagle is the noble soul and he does not hawk for flies, which means that he does not pursue petty ends, or go out of his way to revenge himself on mean little men that have provoked him.</p>
<p>Augustus used to say, “A radish may know no Greek, but I do”.</p>
