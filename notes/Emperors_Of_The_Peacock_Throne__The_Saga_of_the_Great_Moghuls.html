<p>Ibrahim Lodi himself lay dead amidst a pile of corpses, the only Muslim ruler of Delhi (Turk, Afghan or Mughal) ever to fall in battle.</p>

<p>Babur was now forty-three years old. Three decades earlier, as a boy-king on the rickety throne of an obscure, war-torn principality, he had dared to dream grand dreams, and now at last, after endless struggles and many misfortunes, he had won a domain to match his vision. Fergana, his ancestral kingdom lost to the Uzbegs, was now a distant memory; Samarkand, the legendary Timurid capital which he had once ardently coveted, a forsaken passion; and Kabul, his capital for twenty-five years, just a provincial outpost. India was now home for Babur.</p>
<p>Towns and villages fortified themselves and would not submit without a fight. India, it seemed, would have to be conquered inch by inch.</p>
