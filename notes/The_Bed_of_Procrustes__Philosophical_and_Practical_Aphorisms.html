                <p>Modernity’s double punishment is to make us both age prematurely and live longer.</p>

<p>I wonder whether a bitter enemy would be jealous if he discovered that I hated someone else.</p>
<p>By praising someone for his lack of defects you are also implying his lack of virtues.</p>
<p>Older people are most beautiful when they have what is lacking in the young: poise, erudition, wisdom, phronesis, and this post-heroic absence of agitation.</p>
<p>What fools call “wasting time” is most often the best investment.</p>
<p>Read nothing from the past one hundred years; eat no fruits from the past one thousand years; drink nothing from the past four thousand years (just wine and water); but talk to no ordinary man over forty. A man without a heroic bent starts dying at the age of thirty.</p>
<p>Karl Marx, a visionary, figured out that you can control a slave much better by convincing him he is an employee.</p>
<p>The fastest way to become rich is to socialize with the poor; the fastest way to become poor is to socialize with the rich.</p>
<p>Someone who says “I am busy” is either declaring incompetence (and lack of control of his life) or trying to get rid of you.</p>
<p>Modernity: we created youth without heroism, age without wisdom, and life without grandeur.</p>
<p>You can tell how uninteresting a person is by asking him whom he finds interesting.</p>
<p>People focus on role models; it is more effective to find antimodels—people you don’t want to resemble when you grow up. – It is a good practice to always apologize, except when you have done something wrong.</p>
<p>My only measure of success is how much time you have to kill.</p>
<p>Men destroy each other during war; themselves during peacetime.</p>
<p>You have a real life if and only if you do not compete with anyone in any of your pursuits.</p>
<p>Only in recent history has “working hard” signaled pride rather than shame for lack of talent, finesse, and, mostly, sprezzatura.</p>
<p>Writers are remembered for their best work, politicians for their worst mistakes, and businessmen are almost never remembered.</p>
<p>good maxim allows you to have the last word without even starting a conversation.</p>

<p>A good maxim allows you to have the last word without even starting a conversation.</p>
<p>A genius is someone with flaws harder to imitate than his qualities.</p>
<p>In the past, most were ignorant, one in a thousand were refined enough to talk to. Today, literacy is higher, but thanks to progress, the media, and finance, only one in ten thousand.</p>
<p>What I learned on my own I still remember.</p>
<p>In classical renderings of prominent figures, males are lean and females are plump; in modern photographs, the opposite.</p>
<p>you find any reason why you and someone are friends, you are not friends.</p>
<p>If you find any reason why you and someone are friends, you are not friends.</p>
<p>True humility is when you can surprise yourself more than others; the rest is either shyness or good marketing.</p>
<p>You can only convince people who think they can benefit from being convinced.</p>
<p>Even the cheapest misers can be generous with advice.</p>
<p>I wonder if crooks can conceive that honest people can be shrewder than they.</p>
<p>In a crowd of a hundred, 50 percent of the wealth, 90 percent of the imagination, and 100 percent of the intellectual courage will reside in a single person—not necessarily the same one.</p>
<p>Just as dyed hair makes older men less attractive, it is what you do to hide your weaknesses that makes them repugnant.</p>
<p>Robust is when you care more about the few who like your work than the multitude who dislike it (artists); fragile when you care more about the few who dislike your work than the multitude who like it (politicians).</p>
<p>Games were created to give nonheroes the illusion of winning. In real life, you don’t know who really won or lost (except too late), but you can tell who is heroic and who is not.</p>
<p>I suspect that IQ, SAT, and school grades are tests designed by nerds so they can get high scores in order to call each other intelligent.</p>
<p>Knowledge is subtractive, not additive—what we subtract (reduction by what does not work, what not to do), not what we add (what to do).</p>
<p>To become a philosopher, start by walking very slowly.</p>
<p>Conscious ignorance, if you can practice it, expands your</p>
<p>Conscious ignorance, if you can practice it, expands your world; it can make things infinite.</p>
<p>There are designations, like “economist,” “prostitute,” or “consultant,” for which additional characterization doesn’t add information.</p>
<p>“It is much easier to scam people for billions than for just millions.”</p>
<p>Don’t cross a river, because it is on average four feet deep. This is also known as Jensen’s inequality.</p>
<p>The mediocre regret their words more than their silence; finer men regret their silence more than their words; the magnificent has nothing to regret.</p>
<p>In the past, only some of the males, but all of the females, were able to procreate. Equality is more natural for females.</p>
<p>verbal threat is the most authentic certificate of impotence.</p>
<p>The classical man’s worst fear was inglorious death; the modern man’s worst fear is just death.</p>
<p>You know you have influence when people start noticing your absence more than the presence of others.</p>
<p>When someone says “I am not that stupid,” it often means that he is more stupid than he thinks.</p>
<p>We expect places and products to be less attractive than in marketing brochures, but we never forgive humans for being worse than their first impressions.</p>
<p>You will get the most attention from those who hate you. No friend, no admirer, and no partner will flatter you with as much curiosity.</p>
