                <p>The money rewards and widespread though ephemeral fame which those agencies have made possible places temptations in the way of able men which are difficult to resist.

When Milton wanted to exercise &quot;that one talent which is death to hide,&quot; he felt that his soul was &quot;bent to serve therewith my Maker.&quot; Every religiously minded artist was convinced that God&#x27;s aesthetic judgments coincided with his own; he had therefore a reason, independent of popular applause, for doing what he considered his best, even if his style was out of fashion.
