                <p>History is opaque. You see what comes out, not the script that produces events, the generator of history. There is a fundamental incompleteness in your grasp of such events, since you do not see what’s inside the box, how the mechanisms work. What I call the generator of historical events is different from the events themselves, much as the minds of the gods cannot be read just by witnessing their deeds. You are very likely to be fooled about their intentions.</p>

<p>Nobody knew anything, but elite thinkers thought that they knew more than the rest because they were elite thinkers, and if you’re a member of the elite, you automatically know more than the nonelite.</p>
<p>(Independence is person-specific: I have always been taken aback at the high number of people in whom an astonishingly high income led to additional sycophancy as they became more dependent on their clients and employers and more addicted to making even more money.)</p>

<p>contribute much individually—only collectively. I can state the supreme law of Mediocristan as follows: When your sample is large, no single instance will significantly change the aggregate or the total. The largest observation will remain impressive, but eventually insignificant, to the sum.</p>
<p>In Extremistan, inequalities are such that one single observation can disproportionately impact the aggregate, or the total.</p>
<p>Notes: 1) For example incudong bill gates in an ensemble of many people. His entry will shift the mean a lot.</p>
<p>Extremistan can produce Black Swans, and does, since a few occurrences have had huge influences on history.</p>
<p>Extremistan can produce Black Swans, and does, since a few occurrences have had huge influences on history. This is the main idea of this book.</p>
<p>Some Black Swans can come from the slow building up of incremental changes in the same direction, as with books that sell large amounts over years, never showing up on the bestseller lists, or from technologies that creep up on us slowly, but surely.</p>
<p>with tools, and fools, anything can be easy to find. You take past instances that corroborate your theories and you treat them as evidence. For instance, a diplomat will show you his “accomplishments,” not what he failed to do. Mathematicians will try to convince you that their science is useful to society by pointing out instances where it proved helpful,</p>
<p>We can get closer to the truth by negative instances, not by verification!</p>
<p>It is true that a thousand days cannot prove you right, but one day can prove you to be wrong. The person</p>
