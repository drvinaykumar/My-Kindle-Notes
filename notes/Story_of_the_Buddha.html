                <p>Kapila, as the hermit was named, gave the brothers much wise advice, and in the end persuaded them to build a city. He marked out the boundaries with golden sand mixed with water, and when the building was finished the city was named Kapilavatthu. The word &#x27;vatthu&#x27; means &#x27;soil,&#x27; and as the hermit Kapila had given the land on which the city stood it was called the Soil of Kapila,</p>
<p>Sakyas, which means &#x27;the Daring,&#x27; or &#x27;Enterprising.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Suddhodana&#x27; means &#x27;pure rice.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Rahula,&#x27; which means &#x27;Impediment.&#x27;</p>
<p>the Buddhists believe that that part of man which survives death will be re-born as a being who inherits the results of his actions—that is, his character, which he has made by his actions.</p>
<p>&quot;How,&quot; thought the Buddha, &quot;will one who is intent on the pleasures of this life, who is heaping up riches for himself, be persuaded that the world is but as froth, even now vanishing away; that the days of man&#x27;s life are as a river running swiftly by, and that nought endures but the righteousness which leads to everlasting Peace?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Holding to the Truth&quot;—of holding fast to what you know to be the right course, instead of listening to any stray advice.</p>
