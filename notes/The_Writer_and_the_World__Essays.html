                <p>In this vast land of India it is necessary to explain yourself, to define your function and status in the universe. It is very difficult.</p>
<p>I have found, as I have said, the psychology of the cell and the hive. And I have been surprised by similarities.</p>
<p>For among a certain class of Indians, usually more prosperous than their fellows, there is a passionate urge to explain to the visitor that they must not be considered part of poor, dirty India, that their values and standards are higher, and they live perpetually outraged by the country which gives them their livelihood.</p>
<p>renonçant</p>
<p>India as an ache, for which one has a great tenderness, but from which at length one always wishes to separate oneself.</p>
