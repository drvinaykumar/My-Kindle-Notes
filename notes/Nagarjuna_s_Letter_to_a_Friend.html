                <p>Generosity and discipline, patience, diligence, Concentration, and the wisdom that knows thusnessThose measureless perfections, make them grow, And be a Mighty Conqueror who&#x27;s crossed samsara&#x27;s sea.</p>
<p>Men, like mangoes, can be sour and yet look ripe, Some though ripe look green, and others green Are sour indeed, while others still look ripe And ripe they are: from this know how to act.</p>
<p>In order that you see the absolute, Get used to truly understanding things. No other practice is there such as this Possessed of special virtues such as these.</p>
<p>Perform no evil, even for the sake Of brahmins, bhikshus, gods, or honored guests, Your father, mother, queen, or for your court. The ripened fruit in hell&#x27;s for you alone.</p>
<p>Faith and ethics, learning, bounteousness, A flawless sense of shame and decency, And wisdom are the seven riches Buddha taught. Know, other common riches have no worth.</p>
<p>A pinch of salt can give its salty taste To a little water, but not to the Ganges stream. So know that, likewise, minor evil deeds Can never change a mighty source of good.</p>
<p>Men who&#x27;ve fathered sons in turn are sons, And mothers likewise daughters. Bitter foes Turn into friends, the converse too is true. Because of this samsara&#x27;s never sure.</p>
<p>Lacking wisdom, concentration fails, And without concentration, wisdom too. For someone who has both, samsara&#x27;s sea Fills no more than the print left by a hoof.</p>
