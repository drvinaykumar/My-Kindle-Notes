<p>Edmund Burke, said in Parliament in London: ‘An event has happened, upon which it is difficult to speak, and impossible to be silent.’</p>

<p>‘What can be said at all can be said clearly; and whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent.’* Wittgenstein would re-examine his views on speech and clarity in his later work, but it is a relief that, even as he was writing theTractatus, the great philosopher did not always follow his own exacting commandment.</p>

<p>Being smarter may help the understanding not only of one’s selfinterest, but also how the lives of others can be strongly affected by one’s own actions.</p>
<p>We have to recognize how unusual Akbar’s policies were for the time. The Inquisitions were in full swing and Giordano Bruno was burnt at the stake for heresy in Rome in1600 even as Akbar was making his pronouncements on religious tolerance in India. Not only did Akbar insist that the duty of the state included making sure that ‘no man should be interfered with on account of his religion, and any one was to be allowed to go over to any religion he pleased’,13 he also arranged systematic dialogues in his capital city of Agra between Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Jains, Parsees, Jews and others, even including agnostics and atheists.</p>
<p>the secular constitution that India adopted in1949, after independence from British rule, has many features already championed by Akbar in the1590s.</p>
<p>Akbar insisted that we should be free to examine whether reason does or does not support any existing custom, or provides justification for ongoing policy; for example, he abolished all special taxes on non-Muslims on the ground that they were discriminatory since they did not treat all citizens as equal.</p>

In1582 he resolved to release ‘all the Imperial slaves’, since ‘it is beyond the realm of justice and good conduct’ to benefit from ‘force’.</p>
<p>Akbar told his friend and trusted lieutenant, Abul Fazl (a formidable scholar in Sanskrit as well as Arabic and Persian): ‘The pursuit of reason and rejection of traditionalism are so brilliantly patent as to be above the need of argument.’16 He concluded that the ‘path of reason’ or ‘the rule of the intellect’ (rahi aql) must be the basic determinant of good and just behaviour as well as of an acceptable framework of legal duties and entitlements.*</p>
