<p>history isn’t algebra. It’s not an exact science. In some ways, literature is a more exact science than history. What a great writer says can become a historical truth.</p>

<p>He had understood long ago that the past was no better than the present. That was as plain as day. One had to try to escape, to wrestle free from every era, so as not to be devoured by it.</p>
<p>Tolstoy, who called this tormented period “the wilderness of adolescence.” Tolstoy came closest of all to describing what he saw in his agitated, disheveled students. There came a moment when they seemed to lose everything that had accumulated in them until that time, and life seemed to start anew. But not all of them were able to find a way out of the wilderness; a significant number of them remained lost in it forever.</p>
<p>But for some reason this metamorphosis didn’t occur in all of his pupils, or even most of them, but rather in the minority. What was the essence of this process? The awakening of a moral sensibility? Yes, of course. But why did it happen in some, and not in others? Is there some kind of mysterious module of transition: a ritual, or rite? Or perhaps Homo sapiens, rational man, also undergoes a phenomenon similar to neoteny, which is observed in worms, insects, and amphibians—when the ability to reproduce appears not in mature specimens, but already in the larval stages?

<p>Music, once it is released by your hands, lives only for a moment before dying away, dispersing into waves moving through space. But the ephemerality of music is just the other face of its immortality.</p>
<p>Notes: 1) Also what comes after the first tone; ie, the second tone, and th next and next to it....the whole sequence of tones make them imortal and sends us deep into the higher field.</p>
<p>finding the right teacher is like being reborn.</p>
<p>Thus, a signal was given, and received. The cold had set in again.</p>
<p>History is dialectical, like life itself, and at times even paradoxical.</p>
