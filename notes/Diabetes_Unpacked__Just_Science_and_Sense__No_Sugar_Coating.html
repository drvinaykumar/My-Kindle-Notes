                <p>Anyway, with regard to the drugs used to treat diabetes, we have metformin – the most commonly used. This helps to reduce release/formation of glucose, from glycogen, from the liver (gluconeogenesis), and increases insulin sensitivity in the muscles. We also have sulphonylureas, there are many of these, which flog the beta-cells to produce more insulin. We have pioglitazone, which is supposed to increase insulin sensitivity in muscle and does something beneficial in the liver. We have acarbose, which stops the body digesting carbohydrates (which are all turned to sugar in the gut). We have other new drugs that increase hormones produced in the gut which stimulate insulin production after eating – in various ways. The most recent drugs are those that prevent the kidneys from reabsorbing sugar, so more sugar is lost in the urine. Hmmmm. As you can see these are all focussed on insulin, and sugar, and nothing much else. Finally, of course, we have insulin itself. More and more people with T2DM are put on insulin to keep the blood sugar down. Of course, people are also told to lose weight and exercise more. People have been told to do this for the last forty years. Obesity and diabetes have both exploded in the past forty years. So this advice has been splendidly effective.</p>
<p>And what substance raises insulin levels more than any other? The answer is carbohydrates. Thus, if you eat a high carbohydrate diet, you will store fat quickly and efficiently. You will become obese, insulin resistant and, eventually diabetic. If you are already diabetic and you eat a high carbohydrate diet, you will become more obese, more insulin resistant. and more</p>
<p>Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, obesity and cancers all involve chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and free radical formation. But these factors do not cause the disease; they only indicate the presence of the disease.</p>
<p>Some is stored as glycogen in the liver, but the amount that can be stored this way is limited. Insulin converts the excess carbohydrate via DNL to fatty acids, which are packaged with glycerol to form triglycerides, the storage form of fat.</p>
<p>At its very core, T2DM can be understood as too much glucose and too much insulin. The solution becomes immediately obvious. We must lower the insulin and lower the glucose. The sugar is not just in the blood. That’s only part of the problem. There’s too much sugar in our entire body.</p>
<p>prescribes a medication such as insulin. But insulin does not rid the body of that excess sugar. Instead, it simply takes the blood sugar and rams it back into the liver. The liver doesn’t want it either, so it ships it out to all the other organs – the kidneys, the nerves, the eyes, and the heart. Much of this extra sugar will also just get turned into fat.</p>
<p>The blood sugars got better with insulin, but the diabetes got worse. This unfortunately happens to virtually every patient. The higher dose of medications only hides the blood sugar by cramming it into the engorged body. The diabetes looks better, but actually is getting worse. Doctors</p>
<p>The End Game What happens over ten or twenty years? Every single part of the body just starts to rot. This is precisely why T2DM, unlike virtually any other disease, affects every single part of the body. Every organ suffers the long-term effects of the excessive sugar load. Your eyes rot – and you go blind.</p>
<p>The End Game What happens over ten or twenty years? Every single part of the body just starts to rot. This is precisely why T2DM, unlike virtually any other disease, affects every single part of the body. Every organ suffers the long-term effects of the excessive sugar load. Your eyes rot – and you go blind. Your kidneys rot – and you need dialysis. You heart rots – and you get heart attacks and heart failure. Your brain rots – and you get Alzheimer’s disease. Your liver rots – and you get fatty liver disease and cirrhosis. Your legs rot – and you get diabetic foot ulcers. Your nerves rot – and you get diabetic neuropathy. No part of your body is spared.</p>
<p>There are really only two ways to get rid of the excessive sugar in the body. Don’t put sugar in. Burn it off.</p>
<p>Instead focus on eating lots of vegetables and natural healthy fats.</p>
<p>Natural fats, such as found in avocado, nuts and olive oil are well known to have healthy effects on both heart disease and diabetes.</p>
<p>Dietary cholesterol has also been shown to have no harmful effect on the human body. Eggs and butter are excellent sources of natural fats, which have minimal effect on blood glucose or insulin.</p>
<p>Low refined carbohydrates, moderate protein and high natural fats.</p>
<p>Fasting is the simplest and surest method to force your body to burn sugar.</p>
<p>T2DM is merely excessive glucose in the body, so burning it off will reverse the disease.</p>
<p>T2DM is simply the result of chronic excessive carbohydrate consumption beyond the genetically predetermined maximum carbohydrate handling capacity of the insulin-glucagon hormonal system.</p>
<p>No medication cures T2DM because medications do not treat the cause of T2DM. Medications only slow down the progression of the disease, merely altering the handling of sugar that is already in the system.</p>
<p>In the spectrum of what we have mislabeled as “food”, exclusively carbohydrates are highly addictive2 and in excess directly or indirectly cause a variety of Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases (CNCDs) including T2DM and obesity.</p>
<p>Under the control of the hunger-satiety system, it is virtually impossible to overeat essential foods, become unhealthily obese or develop any of the dietary CNCDs such as T2DM</p>
<p>No essential nutrient activates the endorphin pathway. Under the control of the hunger-satiety system, it is virtually impossible to overeat essential foods, become unhealthily obese or develop any of the dietary CNCDs such as T2DM</p>
<p>Carbohydrates, however, are not essential nutrients but powerful endorphin-activating drugs that are not controlled by the genetic hunger-satiety feedback system. At a very early age, the trigger for carbohydrate consumption is hunger or thirst, as part of the genetically-controlled hunger-thirst-satiety feedback system.</p>
<p>You cannot have T2DM if you do not consume carbohydrates. And just as with alcohol, opioids and nicotine, it matters not how the drug enters your face – whether as a simple sugar or as a complex starch, nor how fast it enters.</p>
<p>Any substance with a significant total carbohydrate load is toxic to a diabetic irrespective of the glycemic index or the nutritional additives or the label advertisement.</p>
<p>Treating the glucose level after the sugar has already entered the bloodstream with exercise or expensive medications may slow down progression of the end-organ damage, but does not affect the disease process.</p>
<p>The human brain can only focus intensely for about 20 minutes at any one time; then it needs a short break to recalibrate.</p>
<p>Vulnerability to addiction primarily occurs in two populations – people with authoritarian personalities and people with permissive or hedonistic personalities.</p>
<p>We can measure the strain that chronic excessive carbohydrate consumption puts on the pancreas by measuring fasting C-peptide and insulin levels (variably called prediabetes or insulin resistance). Fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels tell us when a patient is becoming “diabetic” i.e. their insulin-producing capacity can no longer keep pace with carbohydrate consumption and the pancreas loses the ability to maintain the glucose-insulin clamp and blood glucose rises into harmful territory.</p>
<p>Generally, the fatter a person is (another toxic consequence of chronic excessive carbohydrate consumption), the less likely they are to be diabetic because insulin drives sugar conversion to fat, but eventually everyone’s pancreas will fail, weight gain slows, but T2DM ensues.</p>
<p>However, by definition, by the time T2DM is measurable, the diabetic has lost control of their relationship with carbohydrates, and has become a carbohydrate addict.</p>
<p>So, from a nutritional perspective, vegetables are free to eat, but not after “juicing” which is a method of extracting the drug from the food. After a rough stressful day, no person is reaching into the fridge for broccoli to soothe their mental anguish.</p>
<p>Both patients and physicians need to be very aware that blood glucose levels may normalise very rapidly. If the patient abstains from carbohydrates, but continues to take their diabetic medication, they may induce hypoglycemia.</p>
<p>In our experience, most Type 2 diabetics are able to come off their medication with normal blood glucose levels (our definition of remission) within 2-4 weeks of starting the protocol.</p>
<p>Diabetogenesis is the toxicity mediated by chronic excessive carbohydrate consumption irrespective of whether the blood glucose numbers meet a treatment threshold.</p>
