                <p>This sort of deliberate, willful indulgence in unhealthy practices is called in Sanskrit prajnaparadha (“crimes against wisdom”).</p>
<p>The Sanskrit word for immunity is vyadhikshamatva, which literally means “forgiveness of disease.”</p>
<p>The Sanskrit word for immunity is vyadhikshamatva, which literally means “forgiveness of disease.” You retain your health only so long as you are willing to forgive your stresses, shrug off adversity and adapt to new situations.</p>
<p>kshama cha janani: the essence of motherly love is forgiveness.</p>
<p>Treatment of ahamkara is the ultimate medicine. India’s sages have long known that good spiritual health is a prerequisite for good physical and mental health.</p>
<p>Earth is stable substance.</p>
<p>Water is substance without stability.</p>
<p>Fire is form without substance; its characteristic attribute is transformation.</p>
<p>Air is existence without form.</p>
<p>Space (which can also be translated “Ether”) has no physical existence; it exists only as the distances that separate matter.</p>
<p>Vata, Pitta and Kapha are effectively Air, Fire and Water respectively.</p>
<p>Vata, Pitta and Kapha are effectively Air, Fire and Water respectively. Vata, which is the principle of kinetic energy in the body, is mainly concerned with the nervous system, and controls all body movement. Kapha, the principle of potential energy, controls body stability and lubrication. The tissues and wastes of the body, which Vata moves around, are Kapha’s province. Pitta controls the body’s balance of kinetic and potential energies. All of Pitta’s processes involve digestion or “cooking,” even if it is the cooking of thoughts into theories in the mind. The enzymatic and endocrine systems are Pitta’s main field of activity.</p>
<p>These three are forces, not substances. Kapha is not mucus; it is the force which when projected into the body causes mucus to arise. Pitta is not bile; it is the force that causes bile to be produced. Vata is not gas, but increased Vata increases gas. Vata, Pitta and Kapha are called doshas because the word dosha means “a thing that can go out of whack.”</p>
<p>touches as surely as open flame or a bolt of lightning</p>
<p>These characteristics are:</p>
<p>Both Vata and Kapha are cold, and Pitta is hot, so heat is characteristic of Pitta. Heat appears in the body or mind only when there is disturbance of Pitta.</p>
<p>Heaviness appears in the body or mind only when there is disturbance of Kapha.</p>
<p>Vata and Kapha are almost totally opposite one another in quality.</p>
<p>madhuvinashini, which translates as “Killer of Sweet.” Madhuvinashini (Gymnema sylvestre, in Hindi, gurmar) temporarily abolishes the Sweet Taste when chewed. Even after a small quantity of the leaf sugar loses its Sweetness, and your tongue experiences only its texture rather than its Taste. Since sugar’s sole Taste is Sweet, it becomes just like soluble sand. Apples retain their Sourness even after the Sweet is gone;</p>
<p>Cooked onions</p>

<p>EFFECTS OF OVERUSE</p>
<p>The Sanskrit word rasa means, among other things, both “taste” and “emotion.” This suggests that Taste and emotion are identical forces on different planes of existence, that Taste is to the body what emotion is to the mind.</p>
<p>Salty is called “all-tastes” (sarva rasa in Sanskrit)</p>
<p>Ayurveda teaches us that the Bitter Taste is in small doses a tonic for the appetite and digestion. It works this way in the world as well, for a little dissatisfaction can spur you on to greater and greater appetites. Too much dissatisfaction though and you will end up with an excess of Bitterness in your organism.</p>
<p>Vata is cold, dry and irregular. Pitta is hot, oily and irritable. Kapha is cold, wet and stable.</p>
