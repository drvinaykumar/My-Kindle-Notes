                <p>The world vanishes in a moment and is gone.</p>
<p>The hopes of a lifetime, built up little by little with all the energies of a great mind, vanish in a second.</p>
<p>Time never lessens its power; on the other hand, it adds strength to it.</p>
<p>Everything is evanescent. Enjoyment, misery, luxury, wealth, power, and poverty, even life itself, are all evanescent.</p>
<p>That was a religious superstition, and this a scientific superstition;</p>
<p>With every breath, every impulse of our heart asks us to be selfish. At the same time, there is some power beyond us which says that it is unselfishness alone which is good.</p>
<p>What are we to do? The man who has enough to eat and drink is an optimist, and he avoids all mention of misery, for it frightens him.</p>
<p>Saints die and sinners die, kings die and beggars die. They are all going to death, and yet this tremendous clinging on to life exists. Somehow, we do not know why, we cling to life; we cannot give it up. And this is Maya.</p>
<p>And this is Maya.</p>
<p>And this is Maya.</p>
<p>And this is Maya.</p>
<p>And this is Maya.</p>
<p>In this country (England) it is very difficult to become a pessimist. Everyone tells me how wonderfully the world is going on, how progressive; but what he himself is, is his own world.</p>
<p>There must be some to prey on.</p>
<p>The same nerves that carry the sensations of misery carry also the sensations of happiness.</p>
