                <p>Farabi,</p>
<p>Ibn Sina,</p>
<p>greatest official defender of Sunni orthodoxy was Nizam al-Mulk from Khurasan, who also gave the madrasa the purpose and form it retains today.</p>
<p>Rudaki and Asjadi</p>
<p>Ibn Sina, Biruni, Khwarazmi, Farabi, Ghazali,</p>
<p>The construction by poet Omar Khayyam (yes, the poet!) of a geo- metrical theory of cubic equations was a genuine breakthrough, as was his extension of arithmetical language to ratios. Khayyam was the first to identify and classify the fourteen types of third- degree equations and to propose geometric proofs for many that had previously confounded ex- perts. He was also among the first, if not the first, to accept irrational num- bers as numbers. In attempting to prove Euclid’s axiom that parallel lines cannot meet, he produced a new theory of parallels. Two Soviet historians of science concluded that some of the propositions derived by Khayyam in his theory of parallels were “essential y the same as the first theorems of the non- Euclidean geometries of Lobachevski and Riemann,”10 both of whom, it should be noted, lived seven hundred years after</p>
<p>Rashid al- Din, to write the world’s first universal history.13</p>
<p>Biruni,</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that Biruni was the greatest social scientist between Thucydides and modern times.</p>
<p>Farabi, who was called “the second teacher” after Aristotle and who, with Ibn Sina, achieved what many considered to be a harmonious blend of reason and revelation, logic and metaphysics, Aristotle and the Neoplatonists.17</p>
