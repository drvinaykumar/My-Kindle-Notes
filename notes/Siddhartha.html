                <p>they do not contain the mystery of what the exalted one has experienced for himself, he alone among hundreds of thousands. This is what I have thought and realized, when I have heard the teachings. This is why I am continuing my travels—not to seek other, better teachings, for I know there are none, but to depart from all teachings and all teachers and to reach my goal by myself or to die.</p>
<p>&quot;You know how to talk wisely, my friend. Be aware of too much wisdom!&quot;</p>
<p>down to the place where the causes lie, because to identify the causes, so it seemed to him, is the very essence of thinking, and by this alone sensations turn into realizations and are not lost, but become entities and start to emit like rays of light what is inside of them.</p>
<p>This too, I have learned from the river: everything is coming back!</p>
<p>&quot;I can think. I can wait. I can fast.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday, I told you I knew how to think, to wait, and to fast, but you thought this was of no use.</p>
<p>Siddhartha does nothing, he waits, he thinks, he fasts, but he passes through the things of the world like a rock through water, without doing anything, without stirring; he is drawn, he lets himself fall. His goal attracts him, because he doesn&#x27;t let anything enter his soul which might oppose the goal. This is what Siddhartha has learned among the Samanas. This is what fools call magic and of which they think it would be effected by means of the daemons.</p>
<p>Everyone takes, everyone gives, such is life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Writing is good, thinking is better. Being smart is good, being patient is better.&quot;</p>
<p>He always seems to be merely playing with out business-affairs, they never fully become a part of him, they never rule over him, he is never afraid of failure, he is never upset by a loss.&quot;</p>
<p>He saw them toiling, saw them suffering, and becoming gray for the sake of things which seemed to him to entirely unworthy of this price, for money, for little pleasures, for being slightly honoured, he saw them scolding and insulting each other, he saw them complaining about pain at which a Samana would only smile, and suffering because of deprivations which a Samana would not feel. He was open to everything,</p>
<p>Most people, Kamala, are like a falling leaf, which is blown and is turning around through the air, and wavers, and tumbles to the ground. But others, a few, are like stars, they go on a fixed course, no wind reaches them, in themselves they have their law and their course.</p>
<p>Perhaps, people of our kind can&#x27;t love. The childlike people can; that&#x27;s their secret.&quot;</p>
<p>Never before, it had become so strangely clear to Siddhartha, how closely lust was akin to death.</p>
<p>Non-eternal things change quickly, Govinda, you know it.&quot;</p>
<p>had been able to do three noble and undefeatable feats: fasting—waiting—thinking.</p>
<p>he also saw the river going downhill, always moving on downhill, and singing and being happy through it all. He liked this well, kindly he smiled at the river.</p>
<p>Too much knowledge had held him back, too many holy verses, too many sacrificial rules, to much self-castigation, so much doing and striving for that goal!</p>
<p>water ran and ran, incessantly it ran, and was nevertheless always there, was always at all times the same and yet new in every moment!</p>
<p>you had committed your foolish acts in order to spare your son from committing them too?</p>
<p>his father appeared, lonely, mourning for his son; he himself appeared, lonely, he also being tied with the bondage of yearning to his distant son; his son appeared, lonely as well, the boy, greedily rushing along the burning course of his young wishes, each one heading for his goal, each one obsessed by the goal, each one suffering.</p>
<p>&quot;What should I possibly have to tell you, oh venerable one? Perhaps that you&#x27;re searching far too much? That in all that searching, you don&#x27;t find the time for finding?&quot;</p>
<p>Knowledge can be conveyed, but not wisdom.</p>
<p>Knowledge can be conveyed, but not wisdom.</p>
<p>Let the things be illusions or not, after all I would then also be an illusion, and thus they are always like me.</p>
