<p>At no time in the world will a man who is sane Over-reach himself, Over-spend himself, Over-rate himself. —Lao Tzu</p>
<p>All is vanity. What do people gain from all the toil at which they toil under the sun? —Ecclesiastes 1:2–3</p>
<p>Sell not yourself at little price, being so precious in God’s eyes. —Rumi</p>

<p>Think globally; underachieve locally.</p>
<p>Life’s too short. Control is an illusion. Expectations lead to misery. Great expectations lead to great misery. Achievement creates expectations. The law of diminishing returns applies everywhere. Perfect is the enemy of good. The tallest blade of grass is the surest to be cut. Accomplishment is in the eye of the beholder. The 4 Percent Value-Added Principle.</p>
<p>In 1998, a group of business students from the University of Washington asked two of the richest men in the world, Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, what they felt was the biggest single factor in their success. Their reply? Being born and living in America. They didn’t have any control over either. It’s a lot like saying that the best way to succeed in life is to choose your parents well.</p>
<p>The most bitter A scored on a chemistry test is the one on which you were sure you’d gotten an A+.</p>
<p>Benefits don’t continue to accrue at the same rate as effort or investment.</p>
<p>“The nail that sticks up gets hammered down.” If you’re better than everyone else, you had better make sure that they don’t recognize it.</p>
<p>There’s nothing more satisfying than seeing some arrogant jerk boast about his accomplishments in some activity about which his audience neither knows nor cares a whit. Ask yourself, Who really cares?</p>

<p>Being alive at all is by far your greatest achievement.</p>
<p>Underachievers are the best, most dependable workers. This may seem counterintuitive, but the key here is that while some achievement is necessary and good for productivity, a lot of it is dangerous to you and everyone around you.</p>
<p>Face the facts: you’re probably not going to be a millionaire, so why kill yourself? Go home and spend a lazy weekend with your kids.</p>

<p>As Aristotle once said, the mark of an educated individual is to demand no more precision from a subject than the subject itself allows. That seems to apply, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>Remember, underachievement isn’t about doing absolutely nothing. It’s about the right effort at the right time, in the right place. And not one bit more.</p>
<p>You must always work not just within, but below your means. If you can handle three elements, handle only two. If you can handle ten, then handle only five. In that way, the ones you do handle, you handle with more ease, more mastery, and you create a feeling of strength in reserve. —Pablo Picasso</p>
