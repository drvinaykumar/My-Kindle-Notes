                <p>The Buddha said: There are twenty difficult things to attain or accomplish in this world: 1. It is difficult for the poor to practice charity. 2. It is difficult for the strong and rich to observe the Way. 3. It is difficult to disregard life and go to certain death. 4. It is only a favored few that get acquainted with a Buddhist sutra. 5. It is by rare opportunity that a person is born in the age of a buddha. 6. It is difficult to conquer the passions, to suppress selfish desires. 7. It is difficult not to hanker after that which is agreeable. 8. It is difficult not to get into a passion when slighted. 9. It is difficult not to abuse one’s authority. 10. It is difficult to be even-minded and simple-hearted in all one’s dealings with others. 11. It is difficult to be thorough in learning and exhaustive in investigation. 12. It is difficult to subdue selfish pride. 13. It is difficult not to feel contempt toward the unlearned. 14. It is difficult to be one in knowledge and practice. 15. It is difficult not to express an opinion about others. 16. It is by rare opportunity that one is introduced to a true spiritual teacher. 17. It is difficult to gain an insight into the nature of being, and to practice the Way. 18. It is difficult to follow the steps of a savior. 19. It is difficult to be always the master of oneself. 20. It is difficult to understand thoroughly the ways of Buddha.</p>
