                <p>Emerson said that a library is a magic chamber in which there are many enchanted spirits. They wake when we call them. When the book lies unopened, it is literally, geometrically, a volume, a thing among things. When we open it, when the book surrenders itself to its reader, the aesthetic event occurs. And even for the same reader the same book changes, for we change; we are the river of Heraclitus, who said that the man of yesterday is not the man of today, who will not be the man of tomorrow. We change incessantly, and each reading of a book, each rereading, each memory of that rereading, reinvents the text.</p>

<p>There are people who barely feel poetry, and they are generally dedicated to teaching it.</p>
<p>It pains us that they have destroyed those beautiful trees, but to nature it doesn&#x27;t matter. Nature if there exists an entity called Nature knows that it can restore them. The river keeps flowing.</p>
<p>Persian poet Hafiz: “I fly, my dust will be what I am.”</p>
<p>Persian poet Hafiz: “I fly, my dust will be what I am.” In this there is the whole doctrine of transmigration.</p>
<p>Persian poet Hafiz: “I fly, my dust will be what I am.” In this there is the whole doctrine of transmigration. “My dust will be what I am.” I will be reborn again and again; in another country, I will be Hafiz, the poet.</p>
<p>La rosa sin porqué florece porque florece. Die Rose ist ohne warum; sie blühet weil sie blühet. [The rose has no why, it flowers because it flowers.]</p>
<p>Classic comes from classis: a frigate, a fleet. A classic book is a well-run book; everything must be on board it―shipshape as they say in English.</p>
<p>Plato where he says that books are like statues: they may seem alive, but when you ask them something they do not reply.</p>
<p>Aristotle. He had just published his Metaphysics―that is, he had ordered various copies to be made. Alexander rebuked him, saying that now everyone could know what was previously known only to the elect. Aristotle responded in his own defense, no doubt with sincerity: “My treatise has been published and not published.” He did not believe that a book expounded a subject completely, but rather that it served as a sort of guide to accompany oral instruction.</p>
<p>Rudolf Steiner, in his books on anthroposophy, which was the name he gave to his theosophy. He said that when something ends, we must think that something begins. His advice is salutory, but the execution is difficult, for we only know what we have lost, not what we will gain. We have a very precise image an image at times shameless of what we have lost, but we are ignorant of what may follow or replace it.</p>
<p>after whom we name England since Angle-land,</p>
<p>Spanish poet, Fray Luis de León: Vivir quiero conmigo, gozar quiero del bien que debo al cielo, a solas sin testigo, libre de amor, de celo, de odio, de esperanza, de recelo. [I want to live with myself, I want to enjoy the good that I owe to heaven, alone, without witnesses, free of love, of jealousy, of hate, of hope, of fear.]</p>
<p>According to the Socratic phrase, who can know himself more than the blind man?</p>
<p>writer, or any man, must believe that whatever happens to him is an instrument; everything has been given for an end. This is even stronger in the case of the artist. Everything that happens, including humiliations, embarrassments, misfortunes, all has been given like clay, like material for one&#x27;s art. One must accept it.</p>
<p>writer, or any man, must believe that whatever happens to him is an instrument; everything has been given for an end. This is even stronger in the case of the artist. Everything that happens, including humiliations, embarrassments, misfortunes, all has been given like clay, like material for one&#x27;s art. One must accept it. For this reason I speak in a poem of the ancient food of heroes: humiliation, unhappiness, discord. Those things are given to us to transform, so that we may make from the miserable circumstances of our lives things that are eternal, or aspire to be so.</p>
<p>I want to end with a line of Goethe: “ Alles Nahe werde fern,” everything near becomes distant. Goethe was referring to the evening twilight. Everything near becomes distant. It is true. At nightfall, the things closest to us seem to move away from our eyes. So the visible world has moved away from my eyes, perhaps forever.</p>

At nightfall, the things closest to us seem to move away from our eyes. So the visible world has moved away from my eyes, perhaps forever. Goethe could be referring not only to twilight but to life. All things go off, leaving us. Old age is probably the supreme solitude except that the supreme solitude is death.</p>
