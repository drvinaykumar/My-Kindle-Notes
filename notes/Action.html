                <p>Inquiry means hesitating, finding out for yourself, discovering step by step; and when you do that, then you need not follow anybody, you need not ask for correction or for confirmation of your discovery. But all this demands a great deal of intelligence and sensitivity.</p>
<p>So, a mind that holds to conclusions is never humble.</p>
<p>The respectable man is not living, he is already dead; and life is not a thing to be invited by the dead. Life is to be entered and forgotten—because there is no ‘me’ to remember the living of that life.</p>
<p>“Is it possible to live without idea, without word, but only with action?”</p>
<p>If you listen without interpreting, without remembering a quotation from some old book, or comparing all this with what you have read, then you will find that your own mind</p>
<p>has undergone a really radical change.</p>
