                <p>the tallest oak in the forest is the tallest not just because it grew from the hardiest acorn; it is the tallest also because no other trees blocked its sunlight, the soil around it was deep and rich, no rabbit chewed through its bark as a sapling, and no lumberjack cut it down before it matured. We</p>
<p>And do you know who wrote much of the software that allows you to access the Internet? Bill Joy.</p>
<p>Achievement is talent plus preparation. The problem with this view is that the closer psychologists look at the careers of the gifted, the smaller the role innate talent seems to play and the bigger the role preparation seems to play.</p>
<p>Their research suggests that once a musician has enough ability to get into a top music school, the thing that distinguishes one performer from another is how hard he or she works.</p>
<p>Their research suggests that once a musician has enough ability to get into a top music school, the thing that distinguishes one performer from another is how hard he or she works. That’s it. And what’s more, the people at the very top don’t work just harder or even much harder than everyone else. They work much, much harder.</p>
<p>The other interesting thing about that ten thousand hours, of course, is that ten thousand hours is an enormous amount of time. It’s all but impossible to reach that number all by yourself by the time you’re a young adult. You have to have parents who encourage and support you. You can’t be poor, because if you have to hold down a part-time job on the side to help make ends meet, there won’t be time left in the day to practice enough. In fact, most people can reach that number only if they get into some kind of special program — like a hockey all-star squad — or if they get some kind of extraordinary opportunity that gives them a chance to put in those hours.</p>
<p>The relationship between success and IQ works only up to a point. Once someone has reached an IQ of somewhere around 120, having additional IQ points doesn’t seem to translate into any measurable real-world advantage.*</p>
<p>Write down as many different uses that you can think of for the following objects:</p>
<p>a brick a blanket</p>
<p>“practical intelligence.” To Sternberg, practical intelligence includes things like “knowing what to say to whom, knowing when to say it, and knowing how to say it for maximum effect</p>
<p>But social savvy is knowledge. It’s a set of skills that have to be learned. It has to come from somewhere, and the place where we seem to get these kinds of attitudes and skills is from our families.</p>
<p>the lawyer’s job was to settle disputes in the conference room, not in the courtroom. “Among my classmates at Harvard, the thing that bright young guys did was securities work or tax,” another white-shoe partner remembers. “Those were the distinguished fields. Litigation was for hams, not for serious people. Corporations</p>

Litigation was for hams, not for serious people. Corporations just didn’t sue each other in those days.”</p>
<p>Hard work is a prison sentence only if it does not have meaning.</p>
<p>The typical accident involves seven consecutive human errors.</p>
<p>The kinds of errors that cause plane crashes are invariably errors of teamwork and communication.</p>
<p>mitigated speech,” which refers to any attempt to downplay or sugarcoat the meaning of what is being said.</p>
<p>In commercial airlines, captains and first officers split the flying duties equally. But historically, crashes have been far more likely to happen when the captain is in the “flying seat.”</p>
<p>“Hofstede’s Dimensions” are among the most widely used paradigms in crosscultural psychology.</p>
<p>But Korea, like many Asian countries, is receiver oriented. It is up to the listener to make sense of what is being said.</p>
<p>Rice has been cultivated in China for thousands of years. It was from China that the techniques of rice cultivation spread throughout East Asia — Japan, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan.</p>
<p>“No one who can rise before dawn three hundred sixty days a year fails to make his family rich.”</p>
<p>Go to any Western college campus and you’ll find that Asian students have a reputation for being in the library long after everyone else has left.</p>
<p>Working really hard is what successful people do, and the genius of the culture formed in the rice paddies is that hard work gave those in the fields a way to find meaning in the midst of great uncertainty and poverty. That lesson has served Asians well in many endeavors but rarely so perfectly as in the case of mathematics.</p>
<p>A mind must be cultivated. But not too much, lest it be exhausted. And what was the remedy for the dangers of exhaustion? The long summer vacation — a peculiar and distinctive American legacy that has had profound consequences for the learning patterns of the students of the present day.</p>
<p>Virtually all of the advantage that wealthy students have over poor students is the result of differences in the way privileged kids learn while they are not in school.</p>
<p>An enormous amount of time is spent talking about reducing class size, rewriting curricula, buying every student a shiny new laptop, and increasing school funding — all of which assumes that there is something fundamentally wrong with the job schools are doing. But look back at the second table, which shows what happens between September and June. Schools work.</p>
<p>Everything we have learned in Outliers says that success follows a predictable course. It is not the brightest who succeed. If it were, Chris Langan would be up there with Einstein. Nor is success simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf.</p>

Nor is success simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf. It is, rather, a gift. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities — and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them.</p>
