                <p>What a sentence names is the subject; what the rest of the sentence tells you (about the subject) is its predicate.</p>
<p>sine qua non—the thing we cannot do without.</p>
<p>Every good sentence contains a subject and a predicate. And within that predicate is a verb that’s finite, a verb that’s fixed in time.</p>
<p>a sound sentence must be independent.</p>
<p>The is adjectival, or modifying: it helps signal which river.</p>
<p>What might otherwise be read as a sentence falls short of being so read if it begins with a word or small group of words like because, after, although, as a consequence, despite the fact that; or because the subject or object of the clause in question is a relative pronoun—which or that or who—none or which will bear the weight of an independent sentence.</p>
<p>The: • subject • verb • object • modifier.</p>
<p>Looking at a sentence this way—focusing on the four functions within it, rather than hunting down and labelling its many individual pieces—exposes the logic of the thing, the structure on which its meaning is strung, or from which it’s falling loose.</p>
<p>Picture this: a courier has a parcel for you; she pulls up at your place and puts it in your hands. If that scenario were a sentence, the courier would be its subject; giving would be its verb, since that is what goes on; the parcel would be its direct object, since it gets given; and you would be its indirect object, since you receive the object. you receive the object that receives the verb.</p>
<p>• Indicative: where the sentence declares a fact: He was an old man and he fished alone. • Imperative: where the sentence issues a command, makes a direction or invitation, or even offers an emphatic kind of wish: Stop right there; Go home; Click here; Drop by on your way through; Keep me briefed; Please tell me what to do; Get well soon; Sleep tight. • Subjunctive: where the sentence asks a reader to imagine an ideal or hypothetical—and sometimes impossible—scenario: If I were you …; He looks at her as though she were an angel;</p>
<p>It’s time to come down now. (Declarative) Do you think it’s time to come down now? (Closed interrogative) When do you think you’ll be ready to come down? (Open interrogative) Come down now. (Directive) Let’s go! (Directive and exclamative) Look at you up there alone with all those rats! (Exclamative)</p>
