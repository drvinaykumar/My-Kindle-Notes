                <p>Cold water scientifically administered as a drink, will reduce excessive heart action while warm water will increase the heart’s action.</p>
<p>Hot water acts as a powerful stimulant, and also as an antiseptic. It also tends to rest the stomach, and as a sedative.</p>
<p>The best authorities agree that the normal amount of fluids that should be taken by the average person is about two quarts every twenty‑four hours.</p>
<p>About one‑half pint to one pint of water is the amount—taken as hot as it can be drunk with comfort, the usual directions being: “Make it as hot as a cup of hot tea.”</p>
<p>In drinking Hot Water, be sure to pass it through the air as described, particularly if it has been allowed to come to a boil.</p>
<p>In sipping water, allow it to remain in the mouth for a moment or so before swallowing. The nerves of the tongue and the mouth</p>
<p>are those best adapted to absorb the Prana from the Water.</p>
<p>often fill the mouth with water, when tired at work, and passing the tongue through it several times, then spit forth the water.</p>
<p>Its vascular mesh is so extensive that it is capable of drawing to it and holding, in cases of necessity, nearly half of the</p>
<p>supply of blood in the entire body, thus protecting the surface of the body from the effects of extreme cold.</p>
<p>Turkish towel, or bath‑toweling.)</p>
<p>“After a cold application the body should never be wiped dry, with the exception of the head and hands and wrists. The wet body should be at once covered with dry underclothing as quickly as possible, so that the wet parts may be hermetically sealed. Then the outer clothing should be put on at once.</p>
<p>we advise exercise to be taken, either a walk or else work, as soon as the person is dressed after the bath, and this must be continued until the person is perfectly dry and warm.</p>
<p>The Hot Bath.</p>
<p>should be begun by a scrubbing off with the bath mits, as before mentioned, and then followed by a “soaking” in the water for say, fifteen minutes, or so. Then before drying, one should take a wash off or douche of water at a considerably lower temperature.</p>
<p>Never take a Cold Bath when the body is chilled. The proper condition is that of a warm body. If you are chilled when you arise, you should warm up the body by exercise before taking the Cold Bath.</p>
<p>Cold Bath is a matter of short duration, and one should hurry through with it. About one minute should be sufficient for the actual application of the water—in</p>
<p>The Cleansing Bath may be taken daily or at frequent intervals. The Hot Bath should be taken not oftener than once a week; and in case one is traveling it will be found that the ordinary cleansing bath will remove the accumulated dirt, without the need of the Hot Bath. Hot Baths are too relaxing to be taken too often. The Cold Bath may be taken daily, or once or twice a week. Be sure to see that you do not have the water too cold—study the reaction as a guide to the proper temperature.</p>
<p>Foot Baths.</p>
<p>This treatment is especially useful in cases of neuralgia; pains in the stomach; pains in the kidneys; headache, etc.</p>
<p>The Hot Foot Bath acts in the direction of drawing the blood from the head, and also as a sedative and quieter of the nervous system. They are found very useful in the cases of headache, pains in the head or neck, neuralgia, cramps, congestion, etc.</p>
<p>The knees, legs and bucket should be protected from the outside air by means of a blanket placed around the legs of the patient, well tucked around him.</p>
<p>It is well to finish the treatment by pouring cool water over them afterward, then rubbing them dry with some friction, and slapping, and then wrapping them up well in dry warm coverings.</p>
<p>The Cold Foot Bath is a wonderful bracer, and its practice will harden the system and render one immune from colds, etc.</p>
<p>It freshens up the entire system after a day’s work, particularly after one has been standing or walking much during the day, and it brings a sense of relief, rest and vigor which is quite grateful to the tired person. It is conducive to a good night’s sleep, and is advisable in cases of insomnia.</p>
<p>The Cold Foot Bath is applied by placing the feet in a bucket of cold water reaching up to the ankles or over. The feet should be kept in the water from one to three minutes, depending upon the patient’s feelings and tastes in the matter. Finish the treatment by a vigorous rubbing of the feet, accompanied by manipulation and</p>
<p>The Hindus practice a “wash‑off” system regularly, in addition to their regular baths. This system consists in washing the body,</p>
<p>from the waist down to the feet, by means of a sponge bath, or similar method—every night before retiring; and a similar process applied to the body, from the waist up to the neck, every morning before dressing.</p>
