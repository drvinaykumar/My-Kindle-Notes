                <p>If our days are gone, let them go!—It is no matter. ‏تسين‏كاپ‏وت‏نوچ‏هك‏نآ‏ىا‏نامب‏وت Do You remain, for none is holy as You are!</p>
<p>If you pour the sea into a pitcher, how much will it hold? One day’s store.</p>
<p>The proof of the sun is the sun: if you require the proof, do not avert your face from him!</p>
<p>دهج‏شياپ‏رد‏راخ‏ار‏ىسك‏نوچ 150 When a thorn darts into any one’s foot, he sets his foot upon his knee, دهن‏وناز‏رس‏رب‏ار‏دوخ‏ىاپ شرس‏ديوج‏ىمه‏نزوس‏رس‏زو And keeps searching for its head with the point of a needle, and if he does not find it, he keeps moistening it with his lip. ‏شرت‏بل‏اب‏دنك‏ىم‏دباين‏رو باي‏راوشد‏نينچ‏دش‏اپ‏رد‏راخ A thorn in the foot is so hard to find: how is it with a thorn in the heart?</p>
<p>A thorn in the foot is so hard to find: how is it with a thorn in the heart?</p>
<p>If every low fellow had seen the thorn in the heart, when would sorrows gain the upper hand over any one?</p>
<p>When your heart becomes the grave of your secret, that desire of yours will be gained more quickly.</p>
<p>When seeds are hidden in the earth, their inward secret becomes the verdure of the garden.</p>
<p>beguiled;</p>
<p>the price of his blood he deemed a robe of honour.</p>
<p>Although the wall casts a long shadow, the shadow turns back again .towards it.</p>
<p>ادن‏ام‏لعف‏و‏تسا‏هوك‏ناهج‏نيا 215 This world is the mountain, and our action the shout: the echo of the shouts comes to us.”</p>
