                <p>&#x27;How long are you going on chewing paper and covering yourself with ink?</p>
<p>&#x27;Have you some foreboding?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Do you believe in such humbug?&#x27;</p>
<p>balderdash</p>
<p>&#x27;What kind of work do you do?&#x27; I asked. &#x27;All kinds. With feet, hands or head - all of them. It&#x27;d be the limit if we chose what we did!&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Oh, he eats sheep, too, and hens and pigs, but if he doesn&#x27;t eat men his belly&#x27;s not satisfied.&#x27;</p>
<p>Free yourself from one passion to be dominated by another and nobler one. But is not that, too, a form of slavery? To sacrifice oneself to an idea, to a race, to God? Or does it mean that the</p>
<p>It&#x27;s nothing much, he asked me to tell you, but it&#x27;s meant well.&#x27;</p>
<p>Men, animals, trees, stars, they are all hieroglyphics; woe to any one who begins to decipher them and guess what they mean ... When you see them, you do not understand them. You think they are real y men, animals, trees, stars. It is only years later, too late, that you understand ...</p>
<p>&#x27;Now whatever is this red water, boss, just tell me! An old stock grows branches, and at first there&#x27;s nothing but a sour bunch of beads hanging down. Time passes, the sun ripens them, they become as sweet as honey, and then they&#x27;re called grapes. We trample on them; we extract the juice and put it into casks; it ferments on its own, we open it on the feast-day of St. John-the-Drinker*, it&#x27;s become wine! It&#x27;s a miracle! You drink the red juice and, lo and behold, your soul grows big, too big for the old carcass, it challenges God to a fight. Now tell me, boss, how does it happen?&#x27;</p>

<p>The greatest prophet on earth can give men no more than a watchword, and the vaguer the watchword the greater the prophet.</p>
<p>African savages worship the serpent because its whole body touches the ground and it 68 must, therefore, know al the earth&#x27;s secrets. It knows them with its belly, with its tail, with its head. It is always in contact or mingled with the Mother.</p>
<p>Some turn their food into fat and manure, some into work and good humour, and others, I&#x27;m told, into God.</p>
<p>So there must be three sorts of men.</p>
<p>Not like here in Greece, where if you ever pinch the tiniest bit of skin off a melon you&#x27;re hauled up before the courts, and as soon as you touch a woman her brother rushes up and draws his knife to make sausagemeat of you! Ugh!</p>
<p>&#x27;Confucius says: &quot;Many seek happiness higher than man; others beneath him. But happiness is the same height as man.&quot;</p>
