                <p>Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions.</p>
<p>whether it concerns the things which are in our own control, or those which are not; and, if it concerns anything not in our control, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you.</p>
<p>But, for the present, totally suppress desire: for, if you desire any of the things which are not in your own control, you must necessarily be disappointed; and of those which are, and which it would be laudable to desire, nothing is yet in your possession.</p>
<p>When therefore we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved, let us never attribute it to others, but to ourselves; that is, to our own principles.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t demand that things happen as you wish, but wish that they happen as they do happen, and you will go on well.</p>
<p>Begin therefore from little things. Is a little oil spilt? A little wine stolen? Say to yourself, &quot;This is the price paid for apathy, for tranquillity, and nothing is to be had for nothing.&quot; When you call your servant, it is possible that he may not come; or, if he does, he may not do what you want. But he is by no means of such importance that it should be in his power to give you any disturbance.</p>
<p>You may be unconquerable, if you enter into no combat in which it is not in your own control to conquer.</p>
<p>anyone provokes you, be assured that it is your own opinion which provokes you.</p>
<p>For how can he who does not frequent the door of any [great] man, does not attend him, does not praise him, have an equal share with him who does? You are unjust, then, and insatiable, if you are unwilling to pay the price for which these things are sold, and would have them for nothing. For how much is lettuce sold? Fifty cents, for instance. If another, then, paying fifty cents, takes the lettuce, and you, not paying it, go without them, don&#x27;t imagine that he has gained any advantage over you. For as he has the lettuce, so you have the fifty cents which you did not give.</p>
<p>you will behave like children who sometimes play like wrestlers, sometimes gladiators, sometimes blow a trumpet, and sometimes act a tragedy when they have seen and admired these shows. Thus you too will be at one time a wrestler, at another a gladiator, now a philosopher, then an orator; but with your whole soul, nothing at all. Like an ape, you mimic all you see, and one thing after another is sure to please you, but is out of favor as soon as it becomes familiar.</p>
<p>For you have never entered upon anything considerately, nor after having viewed the whole matter on all sides, or made any scrutiny into it, but rashly, and with a cold inclination.</p>
<p>first acquire a distinct knowledge that every event is indifferent and nothing to you., of whatever sort it may be, for it will be in your power to make a right use of it, and this no one can hinder;</p>
<p>When walking, you are careful not to step on a nail or turn your foot; so likewise be careful not to hurt the ruling faculty of your mind. And, if we were to guard against this in every action, we should undertake the action with the greater safety.</p>
<p>as in the case of a shoe, if you go beyond its fitness to the foot, it comes first to be gilded, then purple, and then studded with jewels. For to that which once exceeds a due measure, there is no bound.</p>
<p>42. When any person harms you, or speaks badly of you, remember that he acts or speaks from a supposition of its being his duty. Now, it is not possible that he should follow what appears right to you, but what appears so to himself. Therefore, if he judges from a wrong appearance, he is the person hurt, since he too is the person deceived. For if anyone should suppose a true proposition to be false, the proposition is not hurt, but he who is deceived about it.</p>
<p>44. These reasonings are unconnected: &quot;I am richer than you, therefore I am better&quot;; &quot;I am more eloquent than you, therefore I am better.&quot; The connection is rather this: &quot;I am richer than you, therefore my property is greater than yours;&quot; &quot;I am more eloquent than you, therefore my style is better than yours.&quot; But you, after all, are neither property nor style.</p>
<p>For sheep don&#x27;t throw up the grass to show the shepherds how much they have eaten; but, inwardly digesting their food, they outwardly produce wool and milk.</p>
<p>when you are violently thirsty, take a little cold water in your mouth, and spurt it out and tell nobody.</p>
<p>This instant, then, think yourself worthy of living as a man grown up, and a proficient. Let whatever appears to be the best be to you an inviolable law. And if any instance of pain or pleasure, or glory or disgrace, is set before you, remember that now is the combat, now the Olympiad comes on, nor can it be put off.</p>
