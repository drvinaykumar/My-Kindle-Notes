                <p>“The life of the body is an evil and a lie. Therefore the destruction of the life of the body is a blessing, and we should desire it,” says Socrates. “Life is that which should not be—an evil; and the passage into Nothingness is the only good in life,” says Schopenhauer. “All that is in the world—folly and wisdom and riches and poverty and mirth and grief—is vanity and emptiness. Man dies and nothing is left of him. And that is stupid,” says Solomon. “To life in the consciousness of the inevitability of suffering, of becoming enfeebled, of old age and of death, is impossible—we must free ourselves from life, from all possible life,” says Buddha.</p>
<p>were there no life, my reason would not exist; therefore reason is life’s son. Life is all. Reason is its fruit yet reason rejects life itself! I felt that there was something wrong here.</p>
<p>in order to understand the meaning of life I must renounce my reason, the very thing for which alone a meaning is required.</p>
