                <p>Buffett is correct, long–term bonds and other investments vulnerable to inflation should be avoided.</p>
<p>By selling, Buffett is not predicting a decline, though that will surely come someday. He is simply acting on his observation that the intrinsic business values of his holdings are fully reflected in current market prices.</p>
<p>Our goal is more modest: we simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.</p>
<p>Munger denied being humble (of course) but noted that the key to his and Buffett’s success has been that “we’ve had a very low opinion of our abilities.” He said that he’d rather be with a guy with an IQ of 130 who thinks it is 128 than a guy with an IQ of 190 who thinks it is 240. The latter will get you into a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>Munger added that the worst mistakes are made from the nicest graphs and what is really needed is “enlightened common sense.”</p>
<p>Or as Keynes said, “I would rather be vaguely right than precisely wrong.”</p>
<p>Buffett says the party is over, and the hangover will last longer than the party.</p>
<p>Munger: “Everyone talks about the big money made in real estate, but they forget to talk about the big money lost in real estate.”</p>
<p>Buffett: “You can leverage up to your eyeballs, but you may not make it across the river.”</p>
<p>We’d buy great businesses with excellent management at a fair to bargain price and leave them alone.</p>
<p>whether derivative instruments such as index options should exist at all. Munger’s unhedged opinion, “It’s a totally asinine idea.”</p>
<p>rather than worry about economic projections, these brilliant investors focus on finding good businesses at bargain prices within our resilient economy.</p>
<p>He noted that Golden Arches and The Big Store offer great lessons on business.</p>
<p>As Buffett summed up, “If investors only had to study the past, the richest people would be librarians.”</p>
<p>Ben Franklin’s advice: “Keep your eyes wide open before marriage and half shut thereafter.”</p>
