                <p>Cross-examined, the cousins did not confirm this;</p>
<p>I was no more consulted about leaving home than I had been about coming into the world.</p>
<p>We only just caught the train. If we had missed it, it would have been the end of the world. However,</p>
<p>We only just caught the train. If we had missed it, it would have been the end of the world. However, we didn&#x27;t, and the world went on.</p>
<p>And I thereupon proceeded, as far as my private sorrows would allow, to memorise the acrostic-looking task which had been set me.</p>
<p>Moreover Head-masters have powers at their disposal with which Prime Ministers have never yet been invested.</p>
<p>After the first Examination was over, when one surveyed the battlefield, it was evident that the war could not be won without another army being brought into the line. Mathematics was the only resource available.</p>
<p>I owe this achievement not only to my own &#x27;back-to-the-wall&#x27; resolution—for which no credit is too great; but to the very kindly interest taken in my case by a much respected Harrow master, Mr. C. H. P. Mayo.</p>

<p>like great chess-players who play sixteen games at once blindfold and die quite soon of epilepsy. Serve them right! I hope the Mathematicians, however, are well rewarded. I promise never to blackleg their profession nor take the bread out of their mouths.</p>
<p>exactly how it happened and why the tergiversation</p>
<p>minus. I saw exactly how it happened and why the tergiversation was inevitable: and how the one step involved all the others.</p>
<p>The practical point is that if this aged, weary-souled Civil Service Commissioner had not asked this particular question about these Cosines or Tangents in their squared or even cubed condition, which I happened to have learned scarcely a week before, not one of the subsequent chapters of this book would ever have been written. I might have gone into the Church and preached orthodox sermons in a spirit of audacious contradiction to the age.</p>
<p>It was a speech which must have been dear and refreshing to a father&#x27;s heart.&#x27;</p>
<p>Come on now all you young men, all over the world. You are needed more than ever now to fill the gap of a generation shorn by the War. You have not an hour to lose. You must take your places in life&#x27;s fighting line. Twenty to twenty-five! These are the years! Don&#x27;t be content with things as they are. &#x27;The earth is yours and the fulness thereof&#x27;. Enter upon your inheritance, accept your responsibilities. Raise the glorious flags again, advance them upon the new enemies, who constantly gather upon the front of the human army, and have only to be assaulted to be overthrown. Don&#x27;t take No for an answer. Never submit to failure. Do not be fobbed off with mere personal success or acceptance. You will make all kinds of mistakes; but as long as you are generous</p>

You will make all kinds of mistakes; but as long as you are generous and true, and also fierce, you cannot hurt the world or even seriously distress her. She was made to be wooed and won by youth. She has lived and thrived only by repeated subjugations.</p>
