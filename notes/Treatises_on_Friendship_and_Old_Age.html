                <p>Nature, the best of guides, as I would a god, and am loyal to her commands. It is not likely, if she has written the rest of the play well, that she has been careless about the last act like some idle poet. But after all some &quot;last&quot; was inevitable, just as to the berries of a tree and the fruits of the earth there comes in the fulness of time a period of decay and fall.</p>
<p>there is a quiet, pure, and cultivated life which produces a calm and gentle old age,</p>
<p>The great affairs of life are not performed by physical strength, or activity, or nimbleness of body, but by deliberation, character, expression of opinion.</p>
<p>For of course rashness is the note of youth, prudence of old age.</p>
<p>no one is so old as to think that he may not live a year.</p>
<p>I now MISS THE BODILY STRENGTH OF A YOUNG MAN (for that was the second point as to the disadvantages of old age) any more than as a young man I missed the strength of a bull or an elephant. You should use what you have, and whatever you may chance to be doing, do it with all your might.</p>
<p>For nothing gives you uneasiness which you do not miss.</p>
<p>it was a wretched old age that had to defend itself by speech. Neither white hairs nor wrinkles can at once claim influence in themselves: it is the honourable conduct of earlier days that is rewarded by possessing influence at the last.</p>
<p>&quot;The Athenians know what is right, but will not do it.&quot;</p>
<p>For can there be anything more absurd than to seek more journey money, the less there remains of the journey?</p>
<p>&quot;An old man has nothing even to hope.&quot; Ah, but it is just there that he is in a better position than a young man, since what the latter only hopes he has obtained. The one wishes to live long; the other has lived long.</p>
<p>nothing seems even long in which there is any &quot;last,&quot; for when that arrives, then all the past has slipped away—only that remains to which you have attained by virtue and righteous actions.</p>
