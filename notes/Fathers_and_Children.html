                <p>&#x27;I think; here I lie under a haystack.... The tiny space I occupy is so infinitely small in comparison with the rest of space, in which I am not, and which has nothing to do with me; and the period of time in which it is my lot to live is so petty beside the eternity in which I have not been, and shall not be.... And in this atom, this mathematical point, the blood is circulating, the brain is working and wanting something.... Isn&#x27;t it loathsome? Isn&#x27;t it petty?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;man&#x27;s a strange animal. When one gets a side view from a distance of the dead-alive life our &quot;fathers&quot; lead here, one thinks, What could be better? You eat and drink, and know you are acting in the most reasonable, most judicious manner. But if not, you&#x27;re devoured by ennui. One wants to have to do with people if only to abuse them.&#x27;</p>
<p>it! Why do I like chemistry? Why do you like apples?—by virtue of our sensations. It&#x27;s all the same thing. Deeper than that men will never penetrate.</p>
<p>A man&#x27;s ready to give up everything and break with every prejudice; but to admit that his brother, for instance, who steals handkerchiefs, is a thief—that&#x27;s too much for him. And when one comes to think of it: my brother, mine—and no genius ... that&#x27;s an idea no one can swallow.&#x27;</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not for the gods to bake bricks, in fact!&#x27;...</p>
