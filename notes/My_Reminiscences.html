<p>Notes: 1) amazing</p>
<p>The tastiest tit-bit may not be relished when thrown at one&#x27;s head.</p>

<p>by the time he discovers that the morsel is not of the genus stone, but a digestible bonbon, half his allotted span of life is over.</p>
<p>Notes: 1) a</p>
<p>The main object of teaching is not to explain meanings, but to knock at the door of the mind.</p>
<p>Notes: 1) a</p>
<p>The road which leads to knowledge, without going through the dreary process of understanding, that is the royal road.</p>

<p>When other powers are lacking, the power of pricking seems to be at its sharpest.</p>
<p>Notes: 1) as</p>
<p>That which keeps our appetites confined within us, and checks their free access to the outside, poisons our life. Such is selfishness which refuses to give free play to our desires, and prevents them from reaching their real goal, and that is why it is always accompanied by festering untruths and extravagances. When our desires find unlimited freedom in good work they shake off their diseased condition and come back to their own nature;—that is their true end, there also is the joy of their being.</p>
<p>Notes: 1) as</p>
<p>Freedom first breaks the law and then makes laws which brings it under true Self-rule.</p>
<p>Notes: 1) gf</p>
<p>Each one comes here to finish but one book of life, which, during the progress of its various parts, grows spiral-wise on an ever-increasing radius. So, while each segment may appear different from the others at a cursory glance, they all really lead back to the self-same starting centre.</p>
