                <p>Knowing how to prevail in such murky moments is the hallmark of a liberal arts education, and you can benefit from it even if you don’t attend an ultra-selective school such as Harvard, Stanford, or Amherst. Your grades don’t matter as much as your willingness</p>
<p>Well-prepared explorers fare better than hasty travelers, people who count on raw enthusiasm to solve every problem.</p>
<p>Employers want to hire college graduates who write well, speak clearly, work effectively in teams, and know how to analyze complex problems. All those virtues are central to a good college education, particularly in the liberal arts. All of them are</p>
<p>Are you highly self-directed? Can you think outside the box? Can you adapt to a changing environment? Do you thrive on challenges? If you’re nodding your head in response, you’ve got the explorer’s mind-set that enterprises such as Deloitte, Humana, and the Federal Reserve are seeking.</p>
<p>Are you naturally curious? Are you good at connecting the dots? Can you filter and distill information? Are you calm and productive in the face of ambiguity? Those questions come from employers as diverse as the movie creators at Sony, the digital-storage enthusiasts at Dropbox, and the thermostat makers at Johnson Controls. Practically every organization is wrestling with the information age’s awkward disparity: too much data, not enough clarity. It takes training</p>
<p>A liberal arts education is hardly the only way to master such challenges. Keep the number of unknowns under control, and a specialist’s background in business or engineering may prove better. Graduates from either of those programs are well-trained problem solvers too. The foundations of critical thinking aren’t monastic secrets unknown outside the humanities and social sciences. Yet in the most turbulent fields, everything is in flux and nobody’s model works perfectly. When the extent of what’s unknown hasn’t been established, the fluidity and highly developed lateral thinking of liberal arts training can carry the day. A background in the humanities and social sciences helps you get comfortable working with scanty data when nothing better is available. You become good at building provisional inferences when others are stuck. Often your early guesses prove right, making you unusually good at spotting emerging patterns before others do.</p>
<p>Are you a problem solver? Can you act on opportunities? Can you find creative solutions? Can we trust you to make the go/no-go decisions? Organizations such as FedEx, McKinsey, and PayPal ask questions like these when their attention turns to critical thinking.</p>
<p>can’t find my college diploma anymore; it got lost somewhere in the course of ten postgraduation moves. But if I close my eyes, I can still hear a chorus of long-ago history and literature professors asking our classes: “What else? What else?”</p>
<p>Entry-level jobs typically adhere to well-established rules. Someone older and more experienced will tell you what to do and how to do it. This quasi-parental oversight soon fades, especially if you are ambitious. Before long, it’s time to make decisions on your own, even if the facts are hazy and the rules unknown. Your nominal bosses won’t know any more than you do.</p>
<p>Can you build a team? Can you balance different perspectives and agendas? Can you understand the big picture? Can you manage through influence? Employers have been looking for these sorts of socially minded strengths since at least the 1930s. At</p>
<p>“If students have learned to connect diverse texts and traditions, they very likely have developed the skills needed to be liaisons between software creators and end users.” Study sociology, history, or political science, and the same dynamic is in play.</p>
<p>Find people whose college educations emphasized taking a panoramic view of everyone else’s concerns, and those fairness-first attitudes can prevent big trouble down the road.</p>
<p>Can you inspire confidence? Can you energize others to embrace change? Are you concise and organized? Can you convey information effectively? There’s a new urgency in employers’ wish lists when it comes to hiring the type of person who can connect with other people.</p>
<p>When the Association of American Colleges and Universities asked employers recently to list the most important skills college graduates should possess, strong speaking skills showed up at the very top.</p>
<p>Paul Christesen asks undergraduates in the Greece study-abroad program to deliver a half-hour talk at some point summing up their backgrounds, interests, achievements, anxieties, and ambitions.</p>
<p>Getting a bachelor’s degree in English, psychology, history, anthropology, or other liberal arts disciplines doesn’t guarantee you a predictable job at Amalgamated History Industries for the next forty years. You will need to keep improvising your future—and that’s all right. You may switch cities two or three times in your twenties. You may switch employers five or six times. Each cycle of change expands your skills, your horizons, and your intuition for what should come next. You become both student and teacher, able to define opportunities that others can’t see.</p>
<p>Traditionally, our society admires people who go exploring with or without a coherent plan. We celebrate their journeys in movies, novels, and memoirs (such as Yann Martel’s Life of Pi, Cheryl Strayed’s Wild, and J. R. R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit). Everything usually works out in these well-known stories, even if the tiger eats the goat—or the first pair of hiking boots ends up at the bottom of a ravine. Yet when it comes to the college-to-career pathway, well-meaning advisers refuse to see the advantages of improvisation or the rewards of being prepared for the challenges of a turbulent world. Instead, all they talk about are starting salaries, starting salaries, and starting salaries.</p>
<p>Engineers frequently keep that lead for most of their careers, and good for them! For graduates in many other preprofessional fields, however, the earnings curve flattens out. It’s liberal arts majors, particularly those in history, political science, international relations, and philosophy, who see their earnings rocket ahead.</p>
<p>if you sleep through classes, skip the reading, and pay someone else to write your papers, it’s all a charade, regardless of how prestigious your school might be.</p>
<p>how an open-minded spirit of inquiry brought them to a better life.</p>
<p>Among the schools providing especially robust pipelines into good tech-sector jobs: Western Washington University, University of South Florida, San Francisco State, Arizona State, and Temple University. All of them placed at least two hundred liberal arts graduates into tech-sector jobs during the period that Ma studied.</p>
<p>His youngest respondents were in their twenties; his oldest in their sixties. Half of his survey looked at outcomes. Who had risen into leadership jobs? Who was earning at least a hundred thousand dollars a year? And who felt fundamentally satisfied with the way everything in life (family, health, peace of mind) had worked out? With the other half of his survey, Detweiler asked respondents to recall their actual day-to-day habits during college. Who studied a lot? Who was deeply involved in extracurricular activities? Who spent a lot of time talking about social issues with friends? Who got to know classmates with radically different attitudes and backgrounds? And who got to know professors outside of class? All told, Detweiler tracked nearly a dozen important ways that his respondents’ college experiences might have varied. Data in hand, Detweiler began looking for the top performers’ unique edge. The factor that caught his eye: building a close affinity with at least a few professors. About one-third of his respondents had made an extra effort to stop by for office hours, to meet for lunch—and to ask for professors’ job tips, life advice, and other pointers that deepened the mentor-protégé relationship. The payoff: Students who sought out faculty mentors had a 28 percent higher chance of getting a better-than-average first job after graduation. Later on, these graduates were nearly twice as likely to end up in leadership positions. Generally, they felt more fulfilled in life. And they were more likely to be seen as mentors to others.</p>

<p>No matter how renowned or unappreciated your campus might be, there’s someone on the faculty who wants to help you become a bolder, more confident explorer.</p>
